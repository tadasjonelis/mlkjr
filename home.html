            <h2>Martin Luther King Jr's Life</h2>
            <p>
                Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. His father and grandfather
                were both Baptist ministers, and King grew up in a family that placed a strong emphasis on education and
                activism. After completing his undergraduate degree at Morehouse College in Atlanta, King went on to
                earn a degree in theology from Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania.
                <br>
                In 1954, King became the pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. It was
                during this time that he became involved in the civil rights movement, which was gaining momentum across
                the country. King played a key role in the Montgomery bus boycott, a successful campaign to end
                segregation on the city's buses.<br>
                Over the next decade, King became one of the most prominent leaders of the civil rights movement,
                advocating for equal rights for all people regardless of race or ethnicity. He was a key organizer of
                the March on Washington in 1963, where he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. In 1964, King
                was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his efforts to promote nonviolent resistance and
                social justice.<br>
